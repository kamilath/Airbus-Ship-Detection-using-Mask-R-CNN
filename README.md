# Airbus-Ship-Detection-using-Mask-R-CNN
This project is part of the Airbus Ship Detection Challenge, where we detect and segment ships in satellite images using Mask R-CNN. The Mask R-CNN architecture is trained and fine-tuned to identify ships in aerial images, with a focus on high accuracy for detection and segmentation.
